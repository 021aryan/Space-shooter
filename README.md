# Space-shooter
We have created a game called Space shooter using Opengl functions.
1. Gaming in the Field of Software Engineering
In the fast growing field of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growingsector of game development the future is hard to predict. In general software project is a projectfocusing on the creation of software. Consequently, Success can be measured by taking a look atthe resulting software. In a game project, the product is a game. But and here comes the point: Agame is much more than just its software. It has to provide content to become enjoyable. Just likea web server: without content the server is useless, and the quality cannot be measured. This hasan important effect on the game project as a whole. The software part of the project is not the onlyone, and it must be considered in connection to all other parts: The environment of the game, thestory, characters, game plays, the artwork, and so on.

Proposed gaming system
The space shooter is a very attractive game for any ages peoples. The spaceship moves around thegalaxy and protect galaxy from various asteroids and enemies. Asteroids and enemies attacks thespaceship. The spaceship shoots and destroy his enemies and save galaxy. The score are beingincreased automatically by destroying each asteroids and enemies.
3. Why This Project?
Since the 1970s [10], people started to take interest in using their computers as an entertainmentenvironment, thus, the multi billion game industry [3] was starting to take shape. Having presentedearlier the sum of money this industry produces, I decided to have a go and create a game of myown. As a kid, I was always fascinated by the idea of becoming a game developer, but, as yearswent by, I have realized this is not exactly what programming and computer science, as a practice,are about and I dropped the idea. However, the third year project offered me the possibility to try
and achieve one of my childhood’s dreams and I couldn’t resist the
 temptation.
 
4. Objectives of the Gaming System
The game is developed for full-time entertainment and enthusiasms. It teaches the Gamer to bealert at every situation he/she faces, because if the Gamer is not fully alert and notice the saucerfire he/she must be hit by the saucer-bombs.
Though the proposed game is an action game, it doesn’t involve direct violence. No zombie killing,
animal killing, or human killing is performed in the game. So it can also be viewed as a non-violence game.Kids can also play this game, because the design of the game is very simple, controlling the gameis very easy

5. Scope of Our Game
This Report describes all the requirements for the project. The purpose of this research is to providea virtual image for the combination of both structured and unstructured information of my project
“Space Shooter”. This is a single
-player strategy game on the Windows platform. The player willprogress through levels which require precise manipulation of the environment, though the gameEncourages creativity and daring via branching pathways. The episodic structure of the gamefacilitates the pace of the story. I demonstrate the action flow between inputs, script, display(output).We are working mainly with story, levels, object, animation, graphics, scripts, gameengine facilities.
